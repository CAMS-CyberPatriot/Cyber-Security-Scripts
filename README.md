# Cyber Security Scripts
A collection of scripts and programs that help to secure Windows, Ubuntu, and Debian machines.

## Windows Security
### WindowsStigs.bat
This script runs through the STIGS that are available for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, and Server 2012 R2.  This script was made for the Cyber Patriot competition, therefore some of the script may not be applicable to some scenarios, however the script should still work. It also secures a few other settings that I felt would be helpful.
